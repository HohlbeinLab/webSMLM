# webSMLM — Roadmap

Forward-looking notes only: things worth remembering and testing later, not a
history. Shipped features — and the implementation detail behind them — live
in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md); this file doesn't duplicate it.

## Next

- **For later: reconsider the detect/fit/export/table module split.** These
  four already share parameters and data in ways that make the boundary feel
  arbitrary in places — e.g. `PARAMS.gain`/`camoffset` sit under a `----
  export` comment header (`webSMLM.html`) even though the conversion now
  happens inside `fit`, and `table` reads the same already-converted
  `photons`/`bg`/`bgstd` that `export` does. Merging any two of them "because
  they're interwoven" risks snowballing (detect/fit are just as interwoven
  with each other and stay split, so that alone isn't a sufficient
  criterion) — needs an actual principle for where the lines go (kind of
  work vs. data flow) before touching it, not just an ad-hoc merge. At
  minimum, retitle the stale `---- export` `PARAMS` comment to `fit` once
  this is looked at.
- **For later: let a settings JSON override a parameter's `min`/`max`/`step`,
  not just its value.** Today Save/Load Settings only round-trips
  `{id: value}` pairs (see `$('saveSetBtn')`/`$('setFile')`) — the bounds
  themselves live solely in the hardcoded `PARAMS` registry in
  `webSMLM.html` and can't be changed without editing the file. Letting a
  loaded JSON optionally carry `{id: {value, min, max, step}}` and apply the
  bounds to both the in-memory `PARAMS[id]` entry and the DOM control's
  `min`/`max`/`step` attributes (reusing `syncParamControls()`'s write path)
  would let someone with unusual data (e.g. a camera gain far outside
  today's 0.001–1000 range, or a much larger pixel size) relax a boundary
  for their own use without touching the source. Needs a decision on
  whether `saveSetBtn` should also emit bounds by default (so a saved file
  is a full self-describing spec) or only on request (keeping normal saves
  small/value-only).
- **For later: let Load Settings introduce whole new modules, not just
  parameter values.** Today a loaded JSON can only set values for
  parameters the registry already knows about (`PARAMS[id]` must exist —
  see `logParamValues`/`$('setFile')` handler). A further step would let a
  loaded file *extend* the registry itself — e.g. ship a new detection
  filter or fit method's parameters (and, harder, its code) bundled with a
  settings file, so a new module can be dropped in and used without a
  webSMLM.html edit. Needs real design (where does the new module's *code*
  come from in a single-file, no-build app? a `Function`-constructor'd
  snippet embedded in the JSON? a second file?) — flagged here as a
  direction, not scoped yet.
- **v0.10.0 — scriptable / headless pipeline** — run load → detect/fit →
  drift → export without clicking through the UI, so it can batch-process
  files and run an identical scenario across browsers for comparison. Builds
  directly on the v0.9.4 parameter registry — the config object is that
  registry's shape.
  - Small public API: `window.webSMLM.analyze(config) → Promise<result>`
    (locs + per-stage timings + drift), and `analyzeBatch(files, config)`
    looping over multiple `File`s or URLs.
  - Cross-browser benchmark mode: a fixed scenario auto-run via a URL trigger
    (e.g. `?bench=default`) dumping a machine-readable JSON report (per-stage
    timings, worker utilisation, localization count, a result hash) — open
    the same URL in different browsers and diff the JSON.
  - Regression check via the same entry point: fixed-seed synthetic stack →
    assert localization count and RMS error within bounds. There is
    currently no automated test suite at all; this would be the first one,
    and it falls out of the pipeline API for free. Consider also extending
    the synthetic generator to emit known z and known drift, so 3D/drift/
    precision work can be validated quantitatively rather than by eye.
  - Single-file constraint holds throughout: an exposed API + optional
    URL-param autorun, no build step, no bundler.
- **Load/concatenate a folder of individual-frame TIFFs into a stack.** Some
  public datasets (e.g. GATTAquant's GATTA-PAINT download — see
  `experimental_data/README.md`) ship as one TIFF per frame rather than a
  multi-page stack, currently requiring a manual ImageJ concatenation step
  before loading into webSMLM. A multiselect/folder file input that sorts and
  concatenates the individual frames into a stack in-browser would remove
  that external-tool dependency entirely.
- Cross-validate **MLE 3D vs Phasor 3D** on real bead data — only checked
  against synthetic ground truth and mutual self-consistency so far.
- **3D detection beyond astigmatism** — Double Helix, Biplane, etc. could be
  added later as additional methods in the `3D calibration` module, alongside
  today's astigmatic σ_x/σ_y-vs-z approach.
- Cross-validate **NeNA and FRC** against established tools (ThunderSTORM,
  Picasso, FRCbar) — both still ship marked experimental.
- **3D FSC** (Fourier Shell Correlation) — the spherical-shell counterpart to
  2D FRC, once the 3D voxel-grid memory cost is bounded.
- **Multi-emitter fitting** for dense/overlapping PSFs. Single-emitter
  fitting biases positions where PSFs overlap, and a faster single-emitter
  fit can't fix that — a better initial guess doesn't help when there's no
  good single-emitter optimum to find in the first place (see the rejected
  phasor-seeding idea in the v0.3.0 changelog entry, which ran into exactly
  this).
- **Robust detection threshold.** `mean + k·σ_noise` is computed over the
  whole filtered frame including signal, so at high blink density the
  threshold rises and dim localizations get silently dropped — detection
  sensitivity is density-dependent. Consider MAD or a low percentile of the
  filtered image instead. Also: threshold statistics currently include
  border pixels that are never searched for maxima; and plateau handling
  needs a look — the local-maximum test uses strict `>`, so two equal
  adjacent pixels can both survive as separate localizations from one
  emitter.
- **σ_PSF estimation from the data**, instead of a fixed, user-supplied
  value.
- **Photon calibration beyond a single scalar gain/offset.** A scalar
  reasonably approximates an EMCCD chip, but most current SMLM runs on
  sCMOS, where gain, offset and read noise are all pixel-dependent (and
  non-uniform read noise also affects detection — a noisy pixel can
  masquerade as an emitter). Two options, increasing in rigor: (1) estimate
  gain from the data itself via a photon-transfer curve (variance-vs-mean
  across frames, slope = gain — feasible since every frame is already
  streamed through); (2) per-pixel gain/offset/variance calibration maps,
  with a noise model that uses them — see Huang et al., *Nat. Methods*
  **10**, 653–658 (2013), https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2488.
- Optional **fiducial-based drift correction** when beads are present
  (simpler and more accurate than AIM for that specific case).
- **3D point-cloud view** — an interactive, rotatable scatter (orthographic
  projection, colour = z) as an alternative to the depth-coded 2D
  reconstruction, where localizations at different z that overlap in x/y
  currently blend together.
- Localizations-table filter grammar: parentheses/grouping; filtering
  presets; export the currently-filtered subset as its own CSV.
- **Consider deprecating Phasor 2D/3D** in a future release. MLE 2D/3D are
  now the default and statistically superior (Poisson-optimal, reports a
  real CRLB uncertainty), and the worker pool has closed most of phasor's
  historical speed advantage for typical stacks. Phasor's own code is a
  modest ~200–250 lines out of ~5,100 (fit function, its distinct
  magnitude-ratio 3D calibration model, UI, worker/export wiring) — not
  huge, but removing it would simplify the calibration module down to one
  3D model instead of two co-existing ones that currently need guarding
  against each other. Weigh against phasor's one remaining real edge: it's
  still by far the fastest fitter, which could matter for extremely
  high-throughput or huge stacks where MLE's iterative cost adds up.
